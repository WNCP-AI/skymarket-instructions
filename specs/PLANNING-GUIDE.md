# Project Planning Guide: From Idea to Documentation

## Overview

This guide teaches you how to properly plan a software project by creating comprehensive documentation BEFORE writing any code. Following this approach with AI assistants like Cursor will result in better, more maintainable applications.

## Phase 1: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### What is a PRD?

A Product Requirements Document defines WHAT you're building and WHY. It's your north star that keeps development focused.

### PRD Structure & Prompts

#### 1. Executive Summary
**Prompt for AI:**
```
Create a TL;DR section for a [type of app] that [main purpose]. Include:
- One-sentence description
- Primary problem it solves  
- Target audience
- Key differentiator
```

**Example Output:**
```markdown
### TL;DR
SkyMarket is a multi-modal marketplace serving the greater Detroit area that connects consumers with courier and drone service providers for food delivery, parcel delivery, and aerial imaging services.
```

#### 2. Goals Section
**Prompt for AI:**
```
Define goals for this marketplace app:
1. Business Goals - Include specific metrics (orders/week, conversion rates, margins)
2. User Goals - What each user type wants to achieve
3. Non-Goals - What we explicitly won't do
```

**Example Structure:**
```markdown
## Goals

### Business Goals
- Reach 1,000 completed orders/week within 90 days
- Achieve 20% search-to-booking conversion
- Maintain 95% on-time delivery rate
- Deliver $1+ contribution margin by month 3

### User Goals
- Consumers: Find services quickly, transparent pricing
- Providers: Steady income, clear job requirements
- Platform: Reliable operations, dispute resolution

### Non-Goals
- Not building our own delivery fleet
- Not handling enterprise logistics
- Not expanding beyond Detroit initially
```

#### 3. User Stories
**Prompt for AI:**
```
Write user stories for each user type following the format:
"As a [user type], I want to [action], so that [benefit]"

Include stories for:
- Core workflows
- Edge cases
- Admin operations
```

#### 4. Functional Requirements
**Prompt for AI:**
```
List all features needed, organized by:
1. Core Platform Features (P0 - Must have)
2. Provider Management (P0)
3. Business Operations (P1 - Should have)
4. Future Enhancements (P2 - Nice to have)

For each feature include:
- Name and description
- User types affected
- Basic acceptance criteria
```

#### 5. User Experience Flow
**Prompt for AI:**
```
Document the complete user journey:
1. Entry points (how users discover the app)
2. Onboarding flow
3. Core experience (step-by-step)
4. Edge cases and error states
```

**Example Flow Structure:**
```markdown
### Core Experience

#### Step 1: Browse and Select
- User action: Search or browse categories
- System response: Show filtered results
- Success criteria: Results load in <2 seconds

#### Step 2: Configure Request
- User action: Select service details
- System response: Calculate price and ETA
- Success criteria: Real-time price updates
```

#### 6. Success Metrics
**Prompt for AI:**
```
Define measurable success metrics:
1. Business metrics (GMV, take rate, CAC/LTV)
2. User metrics (activation, retention, NPS)
3. Technical metrics (uptime, latency, error rates)
4. Quality metrics (support tickets, refund rate)
```

```

**File:** `docs/specs/design/SCREEN-FLOWS.md`

## Phase 4: Project Documentation Structure

### SkyMarket Implementation Example

Based on the SkyMarket drone marketplace implementation, here's the optimal documentation structure:

```
project-root/
├── docs/
│   ├── README.md                 # Documentation navigation index
│   ├── PRD.md                    # Product requirements document

│       │
│       └── security/
│           └── SECURITY.md       # Authentication & compliance
```

### Updated Folder Structure Principles

Each specification folder contains:

1. **Implementation Documentation**: How the feature is currently built
2. **Integration Patterns**: How it connects with other systems
3. **Configuration Examples**: Environment variables, setup instructions
4. **Business Rules**: Domain-specific logic and constraints
5. **Future Enhancements**: Planned improvements and scalability

### Specification Organization by Feature Domain

- **Core Platform**: API, authentication, business logic, security
- **User Interface**: Components, forms, client-server patterns
- **Integrations**: Payment, email, maps, AI, real-time features
- **Operations**: Deployment, webhooks, monitoring

### Creating Documentation with AI

#### Step 1: Initialize Documentation Structure
**Prompt:**
```
Create a complete documentation folder structure for a [type] application.
Include README files for each folder explaining its purpose.
```

#### Step 2: Generate PRD
**Prompt:**
```
Create a comprehensive PRD for a [description of app].
Include all sections: goals, user stories, requirements, UX flows, and metrics.
Make it specific with real numbers and detailed workflows.
```

#### Step 3: Technical Documentation
**Prompt:**
```
Based on this PRD, create:
1. Technical architecture document
2. Database schema with all tables and relationships
3. API specification for all endpoints
4. Development setup guide
```

#### Step 4: Style Documentation
**Prompt:**
```
Create a complete style guide for this app including:
1. Color system with hex codes
2. Typography scale
3. Component patterns
4. Responsive breakpoints
Use modern design principles.
```

## Phase 5: Using Documentation for Development

### How to Use Docs with Claude Code

#### 1. Load Context for Development
```
@docs/specs/PRD.md @docs/specs/api/API.md @docs/specs/components/COMPONENTS.md
Understand the project requirements and implement a new booking feature following existing patterns
```

#### 2. Reference Specifications During Implementation
```
@docs/specs/payment/PAYMENT.md @docs/specs/forms/FORMS.md
Create a checkout form that integrates with Stripe payment processing for service bookings
```

#### 3. Maintain Architecture Consistency
```
@docs/specs/authentication/AUTHENTICATION.md @docs/specs/client-server/CLIENT-SERVER.md
Add role-based access control to a new dashboard page using Server Components
```

#### 4. Integration Development
```
@docs/specs/email/EMAIL.md @docs/specs/webhooks/WEBHOOKS.md
Implement order confirmation emails triggered by Stripe webhook events
```

#### 5. Business Logic Implementation
```
@docs/specs/business-logic/BUSINESS-LOGIC.md @docs/specs/maps/MAPBOX.md
Add Detroit Metro area validation to the service booking flow with map integration
```

### Documentation-Driven Development Workflow

1. **Plan First**
   - Write PRD
   - Create technical specs
   - Design style guide

2. **Review with Stakeholders**
   - Share documentation
   - Gather feedback
   - Iterate before coding

3. **Develop with Documentation**
   - Reference docs in every prompt
   - Keep code aligned with specs
   - Update docs when requirements change

4. **Maintain Documentation**
   - Update after each feature
   - Document decisions
   - Keep examples current

## Best Practices

### DO's
- ✅ Write documentation BEFORE coding
- ✅ Be specific with numbers and metrics
- ✅ Include edge cases and error states

### DON'Ts
- ❌ Don't use vague language ("fast", "easy")
- ❌ Don't skip edge cases
- ❌ Don't forget non-functional requirements
- ❌ Don't write code before documentation
- ❌ Don't let docs get stale

## Templates and Prompts

### Quick PRD Generation
