# SkyMarket: Marketplace Core PRD
### TL;DR
SkyMarket is a multi-modal marketplace that lets consumers and businesses quickly get food delivered, parcels couriered, or aerial imagery captured—by comparing vetted providers, transparent prices, and real-time ETAs. The core solves the fragmentation of single-vertical gig apps by offering open choice across bike/car couriers and licensed drone operators, with request-to-book or instant booking, in-app escrow, live tracking, and two-sided reviews. Primary audiences are consumers, independent couriers, and certified drone operators. For food delivery, drone operators handle all restaurant coordination independently.

## Goals
### Business Goals
* Reach 1,000 completed orders/week within 90 days of launch across Food and Courier; Aerial Imaging ≥10% of GMV by month 4.
* Achieve conversion (search → booked) ≥20% and reorder rate ≥35% within 30 days of first order.
* Maintain supply fill rate ≥90%, average provider acceptance time <2 minutes, on-time completion ≥95%.
* Deliver contribution margin per order ≥$1 by month 3; marketplace take rate 15–20% with transparent fees.
* Reduce dispute rate to <2% and refunds-per-order to <3% while maintaining NPS ≥60.
### User Goals
* Consumers: Compare providers easily, see all-in price and ETA, and complete a booking in under 60 seconds.
* Couriers: Receive steady, well-scoped jobs with clear payouts and instant withdrawals.
* Drone Operators: Accept compliant, insured jobs with built-in airspace checks, clear scopes, and faster payouts. For food delivery, manage restaurant coordination efficiently.
### Non-Goals
* Building a proprietary fleet or closed logistics network (the marketplace remains open to third-party providers).
* Heavy freight, cross-border shipping, or controlled/illegal items handling.
* Advanced route optimization or autonomous drone delivery at launch (beyond basic batching and scheduled windows).

## Narrative
It's Friday evening and Maya needs dinner delivered from her favorite deli along with a package sent to a nearby event. On her old apps, she'd be limited to one fleet, vague ETAs, and no way to add special instructions. She opens SkyMarket, taps into the Food Delivery category, and sees nearby drone operators with prices, ratings, and real ETAs. She selects her items and adds special instructions for contactless delivery. At checkout, fees are transparent and funds are held in escrow until proof-of-delivery.

Across town, Marco, an independent drone operator certified for food delivery, gets the request with clear payout, restaurant details, and delivery notes. He coordinates with the restaurant for pickup (in the future, an AI call agent will handle this automatically), collects the order, and shares progress through in-app tracking. Minutes later, he completes the delivery with a drop photo. Funds release to Marco instantly, and Maya sends a tip.

The next day Maya needs aerial photos for her business website. SkyMarket's Aerial Imaging category helps her compare licensed drone operators, complete with credentials and insurance badges. The operator runs built-in airspace checks, captures the shots, and uploads a gallery. Maya approves, receives a shareable link, and pays on acceptance. Her website features updated photos that weekend. For Maya, SkyMarket means reliability and choice; for Marco and other drone operators, it means steady, fairly paid work. For SkyMarket, it's a high-satisfaction, repeatable flow that grows both sides of the marketplace.
