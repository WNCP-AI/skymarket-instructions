# SkyMarket Phased Development Approach

## Executive Summary
This document outlines a logical technical development approach for SkyMarket MVP, a drone service marketplace serving the greater Detroit metropolitan area. The approach follows a progressive enhancement model, building core functionality first and layering on features in a logical sequence.

## Development Principles
- **MVP First**: Build a functional marketplace quickly to test core assumptions
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each phase builds on the previous without breaking changes
- **Local Development**: Start with local development before deployment concerns
- **User-Centric**: Focus on solving real problems for Detroit consumers and providers
- **Iterative Approach**: Build, test, and refine each component before moving forward

## Phase 1: Core Platform Foundation

    F --> G[Order Tracking]
    G --> H[Messaging]
    H --> I[Reviews]
    I --> J[Deployment]
```

### Core Dependencies
- **Authentication** must work before any user-specific features
- **Listings** required before booking can be implemented  
- **Bookings** needed before payments make sense
- **Basic payments** should work before adding tracking
- **Tracking** provides context for messaging
- **Reviews** complete the marketplace loop

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- UI/UX improvements can happen alongside feature development
- Documentation can be created as features are built
- Testing infrastructure can be developed in parallel

## Development Tips for MVP

### Start Simple
- Use basic auth before adding social logins
- Implement simple payment flow before marketplace complexity
- Build desktop-first, add mobile responsiveness later
- Use in-app notifications before push/SMS

### Focus on Core Flow
1. User can sign up and create a profile
2. Provider can list a service
3. Consumer can find and book a service
4. Payment is collected
5. Service is delivered and tracked
6. Both parties can review

### Technical Shortcuts for MVP
- Use Convex's built-in auth instead of external providers
- Start with Stripe Checkout before implementing Connect
- Use basic browser geolocation before advanced mapping
- Implement email notifications with Resend before SMS
- Use simple file upload for media before CDN optimization

### Testing Approach
- Manual testing for MVP is fine
- Focus on happy path scenarios first
- Use test data extensively
- Local development with test Stripe keys
- Deploy to staging first for team testing

## Conclusion

This phased approach provides a logical technical progression for building the SkyMarket MVP. By focusing on core functionality first and progressively enhancing the platform, developers can quickly build a working marketplace while maintaining flexibility for future improvements.

The approach prioritizes getting a functional product that can be tested and validated, rather than building a perfect system from the start. Each phase builds naturally on the previous one, ensuring that development effort is always focused on the most important next step.
