# Venture313 AI Buildathon 2025: Learning and Development Plan

## Executive Summary

The Venture313 AI Buildathon 2025 represents a groundbreaking community activation initiative designed to advance Detroit's automotive software engineering talent through progressive AI-assisted development. This comprehensive Learning and Development Plan outlines a structured four-track educational program that guides participants from foundational product development through advanced AI implementation while building a unified SkyMarket drone service marketplace.

**Key Objectives:**
- Deliver hands-on experience with modern development tools and AI-assisted coding
- Create a functional drone service marketplace serving the Detroit metropolitan area
- Build progressive skills across beginner to expert development tracks
- Foster community connections among Detroit's automotive and tech professionals
- Demonstrate practical applications of AI in product development and marketplace operations

**Timeline:** September 19-25, 2025 (7 days)  
**Format:** In-person workshops with virtual support  
**Participants:** Detroit automotive software engineers and local tech talent  

## Program Overview

### Learning Philosophy
The Venture313 AI Buildathon 2025 program employs a **tiered workshop architecture** where participants choose their track based on experience level. The Beginner track creates a standalone SkyMarket implementation in Lovable, while the Developer and Expert tracks work together to build an advanced version using Cursor and additional expert features.

### SkyMarket Application
**SkyMarket** is a multi-modal drone service marketplace designed specifically for the greater Detroit metropolitan area. The platform connects consumers and businesses with licensed drone operators for food delivery, package courier services, and aerial imaging. The program produces two implementations: a standalone Beginner version using Lovable, and an advanced version built collaboratively by Developer and Expert tracks.
