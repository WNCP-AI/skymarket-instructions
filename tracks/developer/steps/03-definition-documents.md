# Step 3: Definition Documents - Understanding Project Specifications

**Objective**: Know what's in the repository and understand why specifications exist. Learn the business domain and technical requirements.

## Overview

Before diving into code, we need to understand the business requirements, technical specifications, and project structure. This step introduces you to the definition documents that guide our implementation.

## Project Documentation Structure

The SkyMarket repository includes comprehensive documentation to guide development:

```
docs/
├── README.md              # Project overview
├── PRD.md                 # Product Requirements Document
├── architecture/          # System design documents
├── definitons/           # Business domain definitions
├── development/          # Development guidelines
└── instructions/         # Implementation guides
```

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### What is a PRD?
A Product Requirements Document defines **what** we're building and **why**. It's the bridge between business needs and technical implementation.

    B --> D[Authentication]
    A --> E[Payments - Stripe]
    A --> F[Email - Resend]
    A --> G[Deployment - Vercel]
```

### Data Models

**Core Entities:**
- Users (consumers and providers)
- Service Listings
- Bookings
- Payments
- Reviews

**Relationships:**
- Users create Listings
- Users make Bookings
- Bookings have Payments
- Bookings generate Reviews

## Why Specifications Matter

### For Development
- **Clarity**: Know exactly what to build
- **Consistency**: Ensure all features work together
- **Quality**: Meet user expectations
- **Efficiency**: Avoid rebuilding features

### For Business
- **Requirements Traceability**: Ensure all needs are met
- **Scope Management**: Prevent feature creep
- **Quality Assurance**: Test against defined criteria
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Everyone understands the goals

## Reading the Documentation

### Essential Documents to Review

**Start Here:**
1. `docs/README.md` - Project overview
2. `docs/PRD.md` - Business requirements
3. `docs/architecture/overview.md` - Technical architecture

**Domain Definitions:**
1. `docs/definitons/users.md` - User roles and permissions
2. `docs/definitons/services.md` - Service categories and rules
3. `docs/definitons/booking-flow.md` - Booking process

**Technical Specs:**
1. `docs/development/database-schema.md` - Data structure
2. `docs/development/api-design.md` - API patterns
3. `docs/development/ui-guidelines.md` - Interface standards

### How to Read Technical Specs

**Focus on Understanding:**
- What problems are we solving?
- Who are the users?
- What are the key workflows?
- What are the constraints and requirements?

**Don't Worry About:**
- Implementation details (we'll cover those)
- Complex technical jargon (ask questions)
- Perfect understanding (it comes with practice)

## Key Concepts to Grasp

### Marketplace Mechanics
- **Two-sided market**: Serve both consumers and providers
- **Platform model**: We facilitate transactions, don't provide services
- **Trust and safety**: Verification, ratings, dispute resolution

### Service-Based Business
- **On-demand**: Services delivered when requested
- **Geographic constraints**: Limited to Detroit Metro area
- **Variable pricing**: Providers set their own rates
- **Quality assurance**: Through ratings and reviews

### Technical Patterns
- **Authentication**: Secure user access
- **Authorization**: Role-based permissions
- **Real-time updates**: Live booking status
- **Payment processing**: Secure financial transactions
- **Data consistency**: Accurate information across the system

## Practical Exercise

### Questions to Ask Yourself

1. **User Perspective**: What would I expect from this marketplace?
2. **Provider Perspective**: How would I want to offer my services?
3. **Business Perspective**: How does this platform create value?
4. **Technical Perspective**: What are the challenging implementation areas?

## Common Patterns in SaaS Applications

Understanding these patterns helps you recognize them in SkyMarket:

### Authentication & Authorization
- User registration and login
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Password security

### CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Users, listings, bookings
- **Read**: Browse services, view bookings
- **Update**: Edit profiles, update listings
- **Delete**: Cancel bookings, remove listings

### Business Logic
- Validation rules (e.g., service area restrictions)
- State transitions (e.g., booking status changes)
- Calculations (e.g., pricing, commissions)
- Notifications (e.g., booking confirmations)

### Integration Patterns
- Payment processing (Stripe)
- Email notifications (Resend)
- Real-time updates (Supabase)
- File storage (for images, documents)

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Find Documentation
- Check the `docs/` directory in the repository
- Look for README files in subdirectories
- Ask for clarification if documents are missing

### Don't Understand Business Terms
- Refer to the glossary in `docs/definitons/`
- Research marketplace and on-demand service concepts
- Ask questions - understanding the domain is crucial

### Technical Concepts Unclear
- Focus on the big picture first
- Implementation details will come in later steps
- Use the resources links for background reading
