# Step 1: Introduction to Spec-Driven Development

## Objective

Understand spec-driven development methodology and how it transforms the way we build modern applications using AI assistance, official documentation, and comprehensive specifications.

## What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-driven development is a modern approach where you:
1. **Start with comprehensive specifications** that define what to build
2. **Load these specs into AI context** (Cursor IDE with Claude)
3. **Access official library documentation** (MCP Context7)
4. **Generate implementation code** that matches requirements
5. **Verify against specifications** to ensure correctness

### Traditional vs. Spec-Driven Development

#### Traditional Approach
```
Vague Requirements → Manual Coding → Debug → Hope It Works
```
- Time-consuming manual implementation
- Inconsistent patterns across codebase
- Outdated practices from old tutorials
- Lots of debugging and rework

#### Spec-Driven Approach
```
Clear Specs → AI Context → Generate → Verify → Ship
```
- Fast implementation with AI assistance
- Consistent patterns from specifications
- Current best practices via Context7
- Built-in verification against requirements

## The Power of Specifications

SkyMarket includes 13+ comprehensive specification documents covering:

- **Business Logic**: Service categories, booking flows, pricing rules
- **Technical Architecture**: Database schema, API endpoints, authentication
- **Integrations**: Stripe payments, Mapbox maps, Resend emails
- **User Experience**: Component patterns, form handling, real-time features

These aren't just documentation - they're the blueprint for AI-assisted development.

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Project Specifications (`docs/specs/`)
Your source of truth for what to build:
- Business requirements and rules
- Technical architecture decisions
- API contracts and data models
- Security and compliance needs

### 2. MCP Context7 (Official Documentation)
Real-time access to official library docs:
- Current best practices
- Framework-specific patterns
- Version-aware examples
- Migration guides

### 3. AI Assistant (Cursor + Claude)
Your implementation partner that:
- Understands specifications
- Generates correct code
- Follows best practices
- Maintains consistency

## How Spec-Driven Development Works

### Step 1: Load Context
```
# Load project specifications
@docs/specs/authentication/AUTHENTICATION.md
@docs/specs/architecture/DATABASE.md
@AGENTS.md
```

### Step 2: Write Natural Language Prompts with Context7
```
@docs/specs/authentication/AUTHENTICATION.md
@docs/specs/business-logic/BUSINESS-LOGIC.md
@AGENTS.md

Implement complete Supabase authentication system for SkyMarket drone marketplace:
- Multi-role support (consumers, providers, admins) per business logic specification
- Email/password signup with verification flow
- Provider onboarding with role-specific dashboard routing
- Session management with Next.js 15 App Router middleware
- Row Level Security policies for marketplace data isolation

Integrate with current Supabase Auth patterns and Next.js 15 best practices.

use context7
```

### Step 3: Generate Implementation
AI creates code that:
- Matches specification requirements
- Uses official library patterns
- Follows project conventions
- Includes proper error handling

### Step 4: Verify Against Specs
```
Verify this implementation:
✓ Includes all auth methods from spec
✓ Uses current Supabase patterns
✓ Handles all error cases
✓ Follows our TypeScript conventions
```

## Real Example: Building Stripe Payment Processing

Instead of manually implementing complex payment processing, you'll:

1. **Load payment specifications**:
   ```
   @docs/specs/payment/PAYMENT.md
   @docs/specs/business-logic/BUSINESS-LOGIC.md
   @docs/specs/authentication/AUTHENTICATION.md
   @AGENTS.md
   ```

2. **Write comprehensive payment prompt**:
   ```
   Implement complete Stripe payment system for SkyMarket drone services:
   - Secure payment processing with multiple payment methods
   - Dynamic pricing with variable service fees
   - Webhook endpoints for payment events and status updates
   - Consumer checkout flow with secure authentication
   - Automatic payment confirmation and order processing

   Integrate with Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript, and Supabase database schema.

   use context7
   ```

3. **Generate payment system**: AI creates production-ready payment infrastructure
4. **Verify against payment specs**: Check pricing calculations, payment flows, webhook processing

**Time saved**: Days → Hours
**Complexity handled**: Production-ready payment processing with secure handling
**Quality**: Enterprise-grade Stripe integration

## Why This Approach is Revolutionary

### For Learning
- **Understand before building**: Read specs to grasp requirements
- **Learn best practices**: Context7 provides official patterns
- **See the big picture**: Specs show how everything connects
- **Build confidence**: Clear requirements reduce uncertainty

### For Development Speed
- **10x faster implementation**: AI generates boilerplate instantly
- **Fewer bugs**: Specifications prevent misunderstandings
- **Less refactoring**: Get it right the first time
- **Rapid iteration**: Quick changes with clear context

### For Code Quality
- **Consistent patterns**: All code follows specifications
- **Current best practices**: Context7 ensures modern approaches
- **Production-ready**: Built-in error handling and edge cases
- **Maintainable**: Clear structure from specifications

## Project Overview: SkyMarket

You'll build a complete drone service marketplace featuring:

### Core Features
- **Multi-role authentication** (consumers, providers, admins)
- **Service marketplace** (4 categories: food, courier, aerial, mapping)
- **Booking system** with scheduling and status tracking
- **Payment processing** with Stripe payments (variable pricing)
- **Real-time updates** via WebSocket subscriptions
- **Email automation** for confirmations and notifications
- **Interactive maps** with Detroit Metro geofencing

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.2 with React 19 and TypeScript 5
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui components
- **Payments**: Stripe payment processing
- **Maps**: Mapbox GL JS
