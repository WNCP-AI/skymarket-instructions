# Step 7: Supabase Overview - Understanding Supabase Services

**Objective**: Understand what Supabase provides (Database, Auth, Storage, Real-time) and how it fits into the SkyMarket architecture.

## Overview

Before diving into implementation, it's essential to understand Supabase's core services and how they'll power your marketplace application.

## What You'll Learn
- Core Supabase services and their purposes
- How Supabase fits into the SkyMarket architecture
- Key concepts: Row Level Security, real-time subscriptions
- Database schema fundamentals

## Reading Assignment

### 1. Supabase Documentation
**Required Reading**: https://supabase.com/docs

Focus on these sections:
- **Overview**: Understanding the platform
- **Database**: PostgreSQL fundamentals
- **Authentication**: User management system
- **Real-time**: Live data subscriptions
- **Storage**: File management

### 2. Key Concepts to Understand

**Row Level Security (RLS)**
- Policy-based access control
- User-specific data isolation
- Security at the database level

**Real-time Subscriptions**
- WebSocket connections
- Live data updates
- Presence tracking

**Authentication Flows**
- Email/password authentication
- Social logins
- JWT token management

**Next.js Integration**
- SSR considerations
- Client vs server usage
- Environment variables

## Analyzing the Project Schema

Use this Cursor prompt to understand the database structure:
```
From @types/database.ts and @supabase/schema.sql, summarize the tables,
enums, and key RLS policies that will affect booking, payments, and messaging.
```

This will help you understand:
- Table relationships
- Data constraints
- Security policies
- Business logic implementation

## Expected Outcome

After completing this step, you should understand:

### Conceptual Understanding
- [ ] What Supabase provides (DB, Auth, Storage, Realtime)
- [ ] How RLS policies protect data
- [ ] The role of PostgreSQL in the stack
- [ ] Real-time capabilities and use cases

### Technical Knowledge
- [ ] Database schema for SkyMarket
- [ ] Authentication flow architecture
- [ ] How Supabase integrates with Next.js
- [ ] Environment variable requirements

### Preparation for Next Steps
- [ ] Ready to create a Supabase project
- [ ] Understand security implications
- [ ] Know what services you'll implement
- [ ] Clear on data model structure

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need PostgreSQL experience?**
A: Basic SQL knowledge helps, but Supabase provides a user-friendly interface and auto-generated APIs.

**Q: Is Supabase free for development?**
A: Yes, the free tier includes 2 projects with generous limits for development.

**Q: How does Supabase compare to Firebase?**
A: Supabase is open-source, uses PostgreSQL (relational), and provides more control over your data.

## Next Steps

With this foundational understanding of Supabase services, you're ready to set up your own Supabase project and connect it to your application in the next step.
