### 06 â€” Repo Orientation

Goal: Know where to find docs, schema, types, and key libs.

Steps
1) Skim folders:
   - `app/*` routes
   - `lib/*` integrations (supabase, stripe, resend, embedding)
   - `types/database.ts`
   - `supabase/schema.sql`
   - `docs/*`
2) Read the project README.

Cursor prompt
```
List the minimum env vars required by the codebase by scanning for process.env usage. Output as a `.env.local` snippet.
```

Outcome
- Mental map of the repo; a filled env checklist.
