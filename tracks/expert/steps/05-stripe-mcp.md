💡 **Expert Tip:** Stripe MCP is most powerful when used for operational intelligence and debugging rather than payment processing. Use it to gain insights into payment performance, identify optimization opportunities, and troubleshoot issues without modifying your application code. Always maintain strict security boundaries and never expose sensitive payment data.
