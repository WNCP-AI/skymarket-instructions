### 06 â€” AI SDK Tools vs MCP: Differences & Use Cases

Goal: Choose the right abstraction for each task.

Rules of thumb
- **AI SDK tools**: in-process, app logic, typed, runs inside your route handlers.
- **MCP**: external tool servers, great for infra/admin, observability, and vendor consoles.

Steps
1) List candidate tasks in your sprint (payments, emails, embeddings, analytics).
2) Assign each to AI SDK tools or MCP using the rules above.

Cursor prompt

Outcome
- Intentional usage of tools with fewer footguns.
