## Learning Philosophy

### Spec-Driven AI Development

Unlike basic AI tutorials, this track emphasizes **specification-driven development**:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understanding business needs for AI features
2. **API Design**: Designing AI endpoints that integrate with existing systems
3. **Implementation Patterns**: Advanced Cursor prompting for AI development
4. **Testing Strategies**: Validating AI behavior in production scenarios
5. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring AI features scale efficiently

### Advanced Cursor Techniques

You'll master sophisticated AI development patterns:

**AI-Specific Prompting**:
```
Create an AI chat endpoint that integrates with our marketplace database to:
- Recommend services based on user location and preferences
- Handle multi-turn conversations with context retention
- Use tool calling to fetch real-time availability
- Implement proper error handling and fallbacks
```

**Integration-Focused Development**:
```
Build AI features that enhance existing marketplace flows:
- Provider onboarding with AI assistance
- Consumer order optimization
- Automated quality assurance
- Intelligent routing and scheduling
```
